Therefore, the AI validation team within RBC’s Enterprise Model Risk Management (RBC Group Risk Management) is tasked with overseeing, assessing, and managing the model risk that may arise from these AI capabilities.

The AI validation team uses machine learning, statistical, and computational strategies to assess model risk. In doing so, RBC is able to identify model weaknesses early and enhance the reliability of production models across all lines of business.

You will also have the freedom to explore ideas that interest you and build your own models and tools.
• Research & Development: You will read research papers (established work and state-of-the-art) to enhance how our team validates models and contribute to our knowledge pool. You are encouraged to apply what you’ve learned to real-world problems, develop reusable software packages, and share your insights with others.
• IT: You will collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to establish and promote best-practices related to MLOps, tooling and IT infrastructure.
• Governance: You will work with model developers (data scientists, researchers, engineers) and business stakeholders to inventory applications of AI and machine learning at the bank, determine their materiality, and assess whether they require review.

• Strong communication and interpersonal skills
• Progress towards a PhD or Master’s degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Engineering, Quantitative Finance, or a related quantitative field

10. Top Data Scientist Skills To Have - Offices To Let: 1) What is a Data Scientist? A data scientist is a role level professional who uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract valuable insights from structured and unstructured data.

They leverage their advanced degree in a field closely related to data science, like computer science, statistics, or mathematics, to analyze complex datasets and make informed business decisions.

2) What are the Main Skills to Master for Data Science? A) Technical Skills Programming A data scientist should ideally be comfortable with several programming languages.

Python, R, and SQL are particularly valuable in this field. Python’s simplicity, combined with its powerful libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, makes it a preferred language for many data science tasks, from data cleaning and visualization to machine learning.

R, specifically designed for statistical analysis and visualization, is excellent for complex statistical tasks that involve exploratory data analysis and modeling.

SQL, although not a programming language in the traditional sense, is crucial for interacting with databases and manipulating data stored in them.

Understanding these languages allows data scientists to wrangle large data sets, perform sophisticated analysis, and build predictive models.

Statistics At the heart of data science lies statistics. A strong foundation in statistics equips data scientists to understand the data, design and evaluate experiments, and make evidence-based decisions.

Concepts like standard deviation and confidence intervals help in understanding data variability and uncertainty. Statistical hypothesis testing methods like t-tests or chi-square tests enable data scientists to infer and make decisions about the population based on sample data.

Understanding regression, correlation, and Bayesian statistics can help in building and refining predictive models.Machine learning is a powerful tool in a data scientist’s toolkit.

It involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Understanding a range of machine learning techniques, from simpler models like linear regression and decision trees to more complex ones like Random Forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks (used in deep learning), is essential.

Knowledge of clustering techniques like K-Means and hierarchical clustering can help uncover hidden groupings or patterns in data.

Familiarity with libraries like Scikit-learn in Python can be beneficial in implementing these techniques.Data visualization is the graphic representation of data, a way to communicate complex information clearly and effectively.

Mastery of data visualization tools helps data scientists convey their findings and insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This involves knowing how to create and interpret different types of visualizations, from bar charts and pie charts to scatter plots and heat maps, each suitable for different kinds of data and questions.

Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python, or ggplot2 in R, are key tools for this purpose. Proficiency in creating dashboards in tools like Tableau or Power BI can also be a valuable skill.

Communication Skills The real value of data analysis and predictive analytics can only be harnessed when its insights are effectively communicated.

A data scientist needs to translate complex technical findings into actionable business insights that can be understood by non-technical stakeholders.

This includes explaining the significance of data findings, justifying the choice of analytical models, and suggesting possible strategic actions based on data insights.

Communication in data science isn’t only about clarity; it’s about tailoring messages for various audiences, visualizing data effectively, and telling a compelling story that drives decision-making.

Interpersonal Skills Data science is not an isolated field; it’s often deeply collaborative. Whether it’s working within a multidisciplinary data science team or liaising with other departments, a data scientist needs strong interpersonal skills.

This includes being an effective listener, understanding others’ perspectives, and being able to compromise when needed.

A positive attitude and a capacity to handle criticism constructively are also vital, as data science often involves trial and error, as well as peer reviews of analytical approaches and models.

Moreover, the ability to effectively collaborate and negotiate with others can drive the successful adoption of data-driven solutions within an organization.

Business Acumen For data science to make a real impact, it needs to align with business goals and strategies. That’s why a successful data scientist often has a solid understanding of the business landscape, including the company’s product delivery mechanisms, operational processes, and business requirements.

This allows them to frame data-driven insights in a context that matters to the organization and to build models that solve relevant business problems.

Additionally, a keen sense of industry trends and market dynamics helps data scientists to anticipate and prepare for future business needs, thus making their contributions more valuable and strategic.

Business acumen, combined with technical skills, positions data scientists as trusted advisors who can provide data-backed recommendations for business growth.
